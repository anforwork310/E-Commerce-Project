# E-Commerce-Project

## I. OVERVIEW
This project explores an **eCommerce dataset** using **SQL on Google BigQuery**. The dataset is based on the **Google Analytics public dataset** and contains information about user sessions, traffic sources, transactions, and revenue data from an eCommerce website.

The objective of this project is to analyze **user engagement and purchasing behavior** through various SQL queries and to generate meaningful insights for business decision-making.

## II. OBECJECTIVES
- [Google Cloud Platform account](https://cloud.google.com/)
- Project created on Google Cloud Platform
- [Google BigQuery API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs) enabled
- SQL query editor or IDE (e.g., BigQuery Console)

## III. DATASET ACCESS
The eCommerce dataset is stored in a **public Google BigQuery dataset**.
To access it:
1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.  
2. Navigate to **BigQuery Console** and select your project.  
3. In the navigation panel, click **Add Data → Search a project**.  
4. Enter the project ID: 
5. Click on the `ga_sessions_` table to explore the schema.

## VI. EXPLORING THE DATASET

In this project, I will write 08 query in Bigquery base on Google Analytics dataset.
